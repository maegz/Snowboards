## Work test to provide a responsive web page from a mockup image and some instructions.

# 1 Responsive web page
The web page should be responsive and work on a phone. The menu shall be visible by clicking on a 'hamburger' icon on smaller devices. Use the design from the Photoshop file.

# 2 Carousel
The carousel should according to the mockup both be able to drag back and forth with the mouse, and also be 'swipeable' on the phone. Also the big arrows should be able to use for going back and forth.
Recommended React based carousel:

# 3 Search
When the user hits 'enter' or clicks on the search icon, a GET-request shall be sent to https://restcountries.eu/rest/v1/name/<search word>. Make an alert with the found countries, alternatively the message 'No countries found'.

# 4 Contact page
Create a contact page that only needs to contain your contact information: name, telephone and email. No styling required. Most important is that it is a separate page and that it is reachable through the menu.

I did it in the (recommended) deprecated 'React-Redux-Starter-Kit'. Done in about 2 workdays.
It was not possible to upload to the GH-pages, so I had to start from scratch with 'Create-React-App'.

Everything should be working. Let me know otherwise!
